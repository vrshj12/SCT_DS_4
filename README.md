Task 4 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
As part of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology, I explored a **global road accident dataset** to uncover patterns and trends related to accident frequency and severity.

## 📝 Task Description
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather
- Time of day
- Severity and causes

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle – Global Road Accident Dataset  
- **Size:** 132,000 records  
- **Features:** Country, Year, Weather, Road Condition, Time of Day, Severity, Accident Cause, etc.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)  

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Histogram:** Accidents by Time of Day  
- **Bar Chart:** Top Weather Conditions in Accidents  
- **Histogram:** Accidents by Road Condition  
- **Pie Chart:** Accident Severity Distribution  
- **Bar Chart:** Top 10 Accident Causes  
- **Grouped Histogram:** Severity by Time of Day  

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Evening and night accidents are more severe.  
- Adverse weather (rain, snow, fog) increases accident likelihood.  
- Top causes include **speeding, distracted driving, and weather conditions**.
